# Configuration for i3
## {alacritty / i3 / kitty / neofetch / picom / polybar / zsh}

```
~/.config/alacritty
~/.config/i3
~/.config/neofetch
~/.config/picom
~/.config/polybar
~/.zshrc
```

(zshrc is out of the ~/.config folder!)

I included also, the systemd config file for disabling hibernation and sleep mode:

```
/etc/systemd/login.conf.d
/etc/systemd/sleep.conf.d
```

And finally X11 config for disabling mouse acceleration:

```
/etc/X11/xorg.conf.d
```

My wallpaper is "cbwp.jpg", have fun!
